# Cathedral

"There are Cathedrals everywhere for those with the eyes to see" -Dr. Jordan B. Peterson

Cathedral is an open-source alternative to Cadence, designed for digital and analog circuit design, simulation, and verification. This project aims to provide engineers, researchers, and hobbyists with an accessible, flexible, and feature-rich EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool.

## Features
- **Schematic Capture**: Intuitive GUI for designing circuits
- **Simulation Support**: Integration with SPICE-based simulators and custom solvers
- **Layout Editor**: Supports multi-layer design and verification
- **HDL Integration**: Verilog and VHDL support for RTL design and verification
- **Open-Source Libraries**: Community-driven component models and design tools
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS

## Technology Stack
Cathedral is primarily written in **C++** for high-performance computation and simulation, with additional scripting and UI elements in **Python** and **Qt/GTK**.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- Python 3.x (for scripting and automation)
- GTK/Qt (for GUI)
- SPICE (e.g., ngspice, Xyce)
- Verilog/VHDL compilers (Icarus Verilog, GHDL)

### Build Instructions
Cathedral is still in development and does not have a fully functional build system yet. Once an initial version is available, build instructions will be provided here.

## Usage
Cathedral is not yet in a runnable state. Future versions will include details on how to start the application and load projects.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions! If you are interested in improving Cathedral, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## License
Cathedral is not currently licensed. A license will be chosen once the project reaches a more developed state.
